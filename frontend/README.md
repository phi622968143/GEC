# React + Vite

##Backend

for backend you need to add media dir
which include product_img product_audio product_description dirs in it,
py(thon) manage.py runserver to start backend server

##Frontend
###Port
I had change to port from 3000 to 1140
###Framework
For the sake of speed, I had changed framework to React+Vite
###Styling
Change the styling from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS
###ProductList
The origin setting is return Loading if there's no product on list
I modified it to navigate to /upload if there's no product on list
good luck!!!!!
