## Required
### Frontend
- install axios
- install react-script
- install react-router-dom
- install Tailwind CSS
### Backend
## Backend

for backend you need to add media dir  
which include product_img product_audio product_description dirs in it,  
py(thon) manage.py runserver to start backend server

## Frontend
### Modified directory
The directory in backend/media is wrong, so I modified it into correct  
### Directory
frontend is for React+Vite  
frontend_ts is for React+Vite+TS  
### Port
I didn't use 3000 as port  
1140 is for React+Vite  
3920 is for React+Vite+TS
### Framework
For the sake of speed, I had changed framework to __React+Vite__
### Styling
Change the styling from __Bootstrap__ to __Tailwind CSS__
### ProductList
The origin setting is return Loading if there's no product on list  
I modified it to navigate to /upload if there's no product on list  
### Other
- If U don't want to use TypeScript, please delete frontend_ts directory after git clone  
- If U only want to use TypeScript, please delete frontend directory after git clone  
__Good Luck__
