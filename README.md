## Backend

for backend you need to add media dir  
which include product_img product_audio product_description dirs in it,  
py(thon) manage.py runserver to start backend server

## Frontend
### Port
I had change to port from 3000 to 1140
### Framework
For the sake of speed, I had changed framework to __React+Vite__
### Styling
Change the styling from __Bootstrap__ to __Tailwind CSS__
### ProductList
The origin setting is return Loading if there's no product on list  
I modified it to navigate to /upload if there's no product on list  
__Good Luck__
